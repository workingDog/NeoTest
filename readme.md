A simple connection test using [Neo4j-Swift](https://github.com/Neo4j-Swift/Neo4j-Swift)

Testing neo4j bolt connection to Neo4j Community servers: 3.5.19 and 4.1.0

Works well with 3.5.19 and with 4.1.0.

With [Theo dev/5.2.1](https://github.com/Neo4j-Swift/Neo4j-Swift/tree/dev/5.2.1) we can now connect to neo4j-4.1.0 with different encryption settings, especially for testing, using "...., encryption: .unencrypted".
